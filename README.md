Script operates on the directory you run the script within!!

Run main.py. If you would like it to use a word dictionary, place a file named wordlist.txt into the directory with the script.
If you do not have a dictionary, it will by default use randomly generated passwords with an 8 character length. 

This also is configured by default to run with a specific site - sngollogns.com.
